						<h1>01</h1>
						<h3>EMPOWERMENT</h3>
						<p>We encourage all of our people to have a critical eye, to take initiative, and to take action to improve our company. This empowerment is characteristic of our trainee programs. We value new trainees for the fresh perspectives they bring to NRB, and consider our ability to adapt and act on disruptive views as one of our greatest strengths. As a trainee, you will be called on to use your unique views to better our organization.

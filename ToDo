To Do:

General
- add functionality to mini-nav so it skips to the right place
- make sure mini navi is aligned correctly
- clicking case study at the footer should take oyu to the case study page.


Master Style Sheet
- determine left margin so all text is at least left aligned (try to make this left margin = right margin)
- align footer text
	- case studies should link to case studies section
	- case studies should be centered with left and right margin (can we make it take up the max space possible given a left and right margin by adjusting letter spacing?)

Homepage
1) Scrolling-header
	- When window is half size, the scrolling-header makes it so there is a weird white space on the right
2) Scroll-Note
	- V is not centered
3) Section2
	- Align text
4) Section 4
	- Align Text
- fix all in section buttons so they link to the right place

Careers
- Can we make the images load before choosing a given group?
- The scrolling function is really buggy if you click on multiple groups: 
	- can we set up some sort of boolean that asks if a gorup has been chosen?  
	- if a group is chosen, and the user clicks on another group, the first group should be closed, and the group most recently selected should open.
	- the group should not close if you double click it

		<h1>WORLD-CLASS R&D FACILITY</h1>
		<hr />
		<div >
			<p >
				In 2000 NRB established a dedicated Engineering & Design Centre at Thane, which has since been recognized by the Indian Department of Science & Technology as a world-class research and development facility. Over the past decade the Engineering & Design Centre has remained on the cutting edge, and today it is equipped with state-of-the-art design and modeling software, benchmarking equipment, and testing and simulation facilities.

		<h1>360Ëš KNOWHOW</h1>
		<hr />
		<div >
			<p >
				At NRB, our expertise and knowhow covers the full range of bearing design, from conception to validation to production. In addition to using the most advanced professional modeling software, we also design our own software and machinery. Our Engineering & Design Centre uses analysis software, simulation software and testing rigs that have been designed and produced in-house. Our plants use automated production and assembly machinery designed by our own engineers.

			<h2>Cageless Bearing</h2>
			<p>Conventional wisdom once dictated that roller bearings consisted of three elements: the shell, the rollers, and the cage.
			</p>
			<p>
				The cage presented an issue when a major truck manufacturer approached NRB with a problem. Their truck bearings were suffering repreated failure in the backside and differential. The bearings had brass cages, which were breaking again and again under large amounts of load. They aked NRB to develop a bearing for them that could withstand the load.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Faced with this problem, our engineers revoltionized the design of roller bearings by simply taking out the cage. Instead, we developed a cageless bearing, composed of only rollers and a shell. This groundbreaking design was able to circumvent the backside and differential issues, completely eliminating the occurence of bearing failure in our customers' trucks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, cageless bearings are commonly produced, not only by NRB but by our competitors.

			<h2>The Kingpin Bearing</h2>
			<p>
				Bearing performance can be measured in life, the mileage it is able to sustain before failure. But one customer approached NRB with a different challenge. Their heavy-duty vehicles used bearings in their steering axles with a life of about 400 000 km, but which required frequent maintenance work, a hassle with large vehicles.
